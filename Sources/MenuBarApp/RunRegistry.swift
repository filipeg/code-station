//
// macOS files an app and everything it starts under one coalition, and keeps the app in
// the Dock, marked "Running in Background", for as long as any coalition of an earlier
// launch still has a process in it. A clean quit sweeps its own. A crash or a force quit
// sweeps nothing, and a daemon stranded that way holds the Dock icon after every later
// quit as well. By then it belongs to launchd and answers for itself, so the coalition is
// the only thing that still ties it to the app, and that number has to be written down
// while the run that owns it still can.
